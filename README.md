# Personal blog

Simple blog powered by Hugo. Along with my side projects, this is a a good place to drop any idea about other projects, toughts about IT project management and IT jokes (Why not?).
Ironically, my blog is written in spanish because naturally I feel more open to express myselft in my ative language.

## Getting Started

This is a Hugo project after all and has been add to Github, so this can be used as proof of concept.

For this README, I used a template from <https://www.readme-templates.com/>
