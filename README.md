# Personal blog

Simple blog powered by Hugo. Along with my side projects, this is a a good place to drop any idea about other projects, toughts about IT project management and IT jokes (Why not?).
Ironically, my blog is written in spanish because naturally I feel more open to express myselft in my ative language.
